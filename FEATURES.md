## 🔧 Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 19
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7
- **Styling**: Pure CSS with modern features

### Backend
- **Framework**: Tauri 2.8
- **Language**: Rust
- **OCR Engine**: Tesseract 5.5.1
- **Dependencies**:
  - tesseract (0.15)
  - serde (1.0)
  - tauri-plugin-dialog (2.0)
  - tauri-plugin-fs (2.0)
  - dirs (5.0)
  - **image (0.25)** - Image processing library
  - **imageproc (0.25)** - Advanced image processing algorithms

## 📝 Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **✅ COMPLETED - Phase 2: Image Preprocessing Implementation**
   - ✅ Add `image` crate to Cargo.toml
   - ✅ Implement contrast/brightness/sharpness adjustments
   - ✅ Implement adaptive thresholding
   - ✅ Wire preprocessing params to OCR pipeline

2. **High Priority** - Enhanced UI/UX
   - Add processed image preview (before/after comparison)
   - Parameter presets for common scenarios
   - Real-time parameter preview
   - Processing progress indicator

3. **Medium Priority** - Advanced Preprocessing
   - CLAHE implementation
   - Bilateral filtering
   - Skew detection and correction
   - Morphological operations

4. **Low Priority** - Additional Features
   - Add drag & drop for images
   - Implement keyboard shortcuts
   - Add OCR history/cache
   - Settings persistence
   - Batch processing mode

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. ~~Image preprocessing parameters (contrast, brightness, sharpness) are UI-only~~ ✅ FIXED
   - ~~The sliders are functional but don't actually process the image yet~~ 
   - ~~Need to add image processing library (e.g., `image-rs`)~~

2. ~~Adaptive threshold toggle doesn't affect processing~~ ✅ FIXED
   - ~~Requires OpenCV or custom implementation~~

3. Screenshot auto-OCR might be slow for large areas
   - Consider adding option to disable auto-processing
   - Or add background processing with progress indicator

4. Temp file management
   - Processed images are saved to `/tmp` and cleaned up
   - On error, cleanup might fail (minor issue)

## 💡 Improvement Ideas

1. Add image compression before OCR for better performance
2. Implement caching for repeated OCR of same image
3. Add batch processing mode
4. Support for PDF OCR
5. Add text formatting preservation
6. Implement table recognition
7. Add support for handwriting recognition models

## 🎯 Goals

- **Short-term**: Complete Phase 2 image preprocessing
- **Mid-term**: Match all core features from original Tesseract-macOS
- **Long-term**: Surpass original with modern features and better UX
