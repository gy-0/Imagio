## 🔧 Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 19
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7
- **Styling**: Pure CSS with modern features

### Backend
- **Framework**: Tauri 2.8
- **Language**: Rust
- **OCR Engine**: Tesseract 5.5.1
- **Dependencies**:
  - tesseract (0.15)
  - serde (1.0)
  - tauri-plugin-dialog (2.0)
  - tauri-plugin-fs (2.0)
  - dirs (5.0)
  - **image (0.25)** - Image processing library
  - **imageproc (0.25)** - Advanced image processing algorithms

## 📝 Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **✅ COMPLETED - Phase 1-3: Full Implementation**
   - ✅ Core OCR with multi-language support
   - ✅ Image preprocessing (contrast, brightness, sharpness)
   - ✅ Adaptive thresholding
   - ✅ CLAHE, Bilateral filter, Gaussian blur
   - ✅ Morphological operations (erosion, dilation)
   - ✅ Drag & drop support
   - ✅ Before/after image comparison
   - ✅ Preset configurations
   - ✅ Keyboard shortcuts
   - ✅ Settings persistence
   - ✅ Processing progress indicator

2. **Future Enhancements** - Optional Features
   - Skew detection and correction
   - Batch processing mode
   - PDF support
   - OCR history/cache
   - Export processed images
   - Auto-optimization suggestions

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. ~~Image preprocessing parameters (contrast, brightness, sharpness) are UI-only~~ ✅ FIXED
2. ~~Adaptive threshold toggle doesn't affect processing~~ ✅ FIXED
3. ~~No progress indicator during processing~~ ✅ FIXED
4. ~~No before/after comparison~~ ✅ FIXED
5. ~~Settings not persisted between sessions~~ ✅ FIXED

**Current Minor Issues:**
- Bilateral filter can be slow on large images (performance optimization possible)
- Temp processed images are kept until app closes (automatic cleanup on exit)
- Screenshot auto-OCR uses default settings (could add option to customize)

## 💡 Improvement Ideas

1. Add image compression before OCR for better performance
2. Implement caching for repeated OCR of same image
3. Add batch processing mode
4. Support for PDF OCR
5. Add text formatting preservation
6. Implement table recognition
7. Add support for handwriting recognition models
