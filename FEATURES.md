## 🔧 Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 19
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7
- **Styling**: Pure CSS with modern features

### Backend
- **Framework**: Tauri 2.8
- **Language**: Rust
- **OCR Engine**: Tesseract 5.5.1
- **Dependencies**:
  - tesseract (0.15)
  - serde (1.0)
  - tauri-plugin-dialog (2.0)
  - tauri-plugin-fs (2.0)
  - dirs (5.0)

## 📝 Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **High Priority** - Image Preprocessing Implementation
   - Add `image` crate to Cargo.toml
   - Implement contrast/brightness/sharpness adjustments
   - Implement adaptive thresholding
   - Wire preprocessing params to OCR pipeline

2. **Medium Priority** - Enhanced OCR Features
   - Add OCR confidence scores
   - Support for page segmentation modes
   - Character filtering (whitelist/blacklist)
   - Better error messages

3. **Low Priority** - UI Enhancements
   - Add drag & drop for images
   - Implement keyboard shortcuts
   - Add OCR history/cache
   - Settings persistence

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. Image preprocessing parameters (contrast, brightness, sharpness) are UI-only
   - The sliders are functional but don't actually process the image yet
   - Need to add image processing library (e.g., `image-rs`)

2. Adaptive threshold toggle doesn't affect processing
   - Requires OpenCV or custom implementation

3. Screenshot auto-OCR might be slow for large areas
   - Consider adding option to disable auto-processing

## 💡 Improvement Ideas

1. Add image compression before OCR for better performance
2. Implement caching for repeated OCR of same image
3. Add batch processing mode
4. Support for PDF OCR
5. Add text formatting preservation
6. Implement table recognition
7. Add support for handwriting recognition models

- README.md: Complete with setup instructions
- Code comments: Basic inline documentation
- This file: Feature tracking and progress

## 🎯 Goals

- **Short-term**: Complete Phase 2 image preprocessing
- **Mid-term**: Match all core features from original Tesseract-macOS
- **Long-term**: Surpass original with modern features and better UX
